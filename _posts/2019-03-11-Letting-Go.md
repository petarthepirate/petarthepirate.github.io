Minimalism. I always thought it was such a pretenious word. Associated with people who
live bare bones, trying to convert everyone to do the same.
But then I sat down and evaulated my life. I didn't feel happy. I found mysef always wanting.
Wanting more camera gear, a better laptop, a better monitor, more money, more time, more energy.
In the end, I wanted to stop wanting. It'd made me unhappy that I didn't have the things I wanted.

So I'm starting a journey. To discover what is important to me.
I want to live a more minimal lifestyle. It doesn't mean I want to get rid of everything I own.
I want to only keep the things I value. I hope this process helps me understand what I value in my life.

It Starts With Clothes
----------------------

Going through the closet is the first step.
Well it's first because its the easiest. Kind of.
It's easy to sort through the clothes I don't wear anymore. The trouble I'm having is going
through the clothes that I don't wear anymore, but they mean something to me.

* The Killer's Battleborn 2012 Tour shirt.
* The Transistor 2016 PAX shirt.

I don't need to get rid of these shirts, but I'm unhappy with just letting them be.
I already began purging my closet because of the KonMarie netflix series. But like with all new year resolutions, this one faded under the waves of life.
